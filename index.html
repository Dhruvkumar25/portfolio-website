    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <article>
      <h3>ML-Based COVID-19 Detection from Lung CT Images</h3>
      <p>
        Developed a machine learning framework using Tensor-Empirical Wavelet Transform (Tensor-EWT)
        and Gabor features for COVID-19 diagnosis from lung CT images. Feature selection was performed
        using Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) and Student’s t-value, followed by classification
        using LS-SVM.
      </p>
      <p>
        Achieved <strong>96.29% accuracy</strong>, <strong>96.56% specificity</strong>,
        <strong>96.03% sensitivity</strong>, and <strong>95% F1-score</strong>.
        This work has been published in <strong>IEEE</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>Crop Disease Detection Using InceptionV3 Transfer Learning</h3>
      <p>
        Built a deep learning-based crop disease detection system trained on over
        <strong>54,000 PlantVillage images</strong> covering 14 different crops.
        Utilized InceptionV3 transfer learning to achieve high generalization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Achieved <strong>91.97% validation accuracy</strong>. Integrated TensorFlow Lite
        for on-device Android inference and combined the system with IoT sensor monitoring.
